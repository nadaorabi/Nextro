  - `score`: Decimal field for grading
  - `feedback`: Text field for teacher feedback
  - `submission_file`: File path for file-based assignments
  - `submitted_at`: Timestamp when submitted

- **Purpose**: Tracks student submissions for exams
- **Key Fields**:

## Usage Instructions

### For Teachers

#### Viewing Submissions
1. Navigate to Assignments/Exams â†’ View specific assignment/exam
2. Scroll to the "Student Submissions" section
3. View submission statistics in the info card
4. Review individual student submissions in the table

#### Understanding Statistics
- **Total Students**: All enrolled students in the course
- **Submitted**: Students who have submitted work
- **Graded**: Submissions that have been graded
- **Average Score**: Mean score of graded submissions

#### Submission Status Meanings
- **Started**: Student has begun the exam (exams only)
- **Submitted**: Work has been submitted but not graded
- **Graded**: Teacher has provided a score and feedback
- **Late**: Submission was made after the deadline

### For Students
- Submissions are automatically tracked when they submit work
- Status updates in real-time
- Teachers can view all submission data

## Technical Implementation

### Database Relationships
```php
// Assignment -> Submissions
public function submissions()
{
    return $this->hasMany(AssignmentSubmission::class);
}

// Exam -> Submissions
public function submissions()
{
    return $this->hasMany(ExamSubmission::class);
}

// Submission -> Student
public function student()
{
    return $this->belongsTo(User::class, 'student_id');
}
```

### Statistics Calculation
```php
$totalStudents = $enrolledStudents->count();
$submittedCount = $assignment->submissions->where('status', 'submitted')->count();
$gradedCount = $assignment->submissions->where('status', 'graded')->count();
$averageScore = $assignment->submissions->where('status', 'graded')->avg('score') ?? 0;
```

### Status Badge Logic
```php
@if($submission->status == 'submitted')
    <span class="badge badge-sm bg-gradient-warning">Submitted</span>
@elseif($submission->status == 'graded')
    <span class="badge badge-sm bg-gradient-success">Graded</span>
@elseif($submission->status == 'late')
    <span class="badge badge-sm bg-gradient-danger">Late</span>
@endif
```

## Future Enhancements

2. **Export Data**: Export submission data to Excel/PDF
3. **Email Notifications**: Notify students of grading
4. **Rubric Integration**: Standardized grading rubrics
5. **Plagiarism Detection**: Check for duplicate submissions
6. **Submission Comments**: Allow students to add comments

### Advanced Features

3. **Time Tracking**: Track time spent on assignments/exams
4. **Peer Review**: Allow students to review each other's work
5. **Auto-grading**: Automatic grading for certain question types

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Only teachers can view submission data for their assignments/exams
- Student data is protected through proper authorization
- File uploads are validated and secured

### Access Control
- Teachers can only view submissions for their own assignments/exams
- Students can only view their own submissions
- Admin access for system-wide oversight

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No Submissions Showing
- Check if students are enrolled in the course
- Verify submission records exist in database
- Check for proper relationships between models

#### Statistics Not Updating
- Clear application cache: `php artisan cache:clear`
- Check database relationships are properly loaded
- Verify submission status values are correct

#### File Upload Issues
- Check storage permissions: `chmod -R 755 storage/`
- Verify symbolic link: `php artisan storage:link`
- Check file size limits in PHP configuration

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check submission data
php artisan tinker
>>> App\Models\AssignmentSubmission::with('student')->get()

# Clear caches
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear

# Check storage
ls -la storage/app/public/submissions/
```

## Migration Commands

### To Apply Changes
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### To Rollback Changes
```bash
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=2
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] View assignment with no submissions
- [ ] View assignment with submissions
- [ ] Check statistics calculation
- [ ] Verify student information display
- [ ] Test status badge colors
- [ ] Check score display format
- [ ] Verify timestamp formatting
- [ ] Test with different submission statuses

### Database Testing
- [ ] Create test submissions
- [ ] Verify unique constraints
- [ ] Test relationship loading
- [ ] Check statistics calculations
- [ ] Validate data integrity

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Tips
1. **Eager Loading**: Always load relationships when needed
2. **Indexing**: Add database indexes for frequently queried fields
3. **Caching**: Cache statistics for large datasets
4. **Pagination**: Implement pagination for large submission lists

### Database Indexes
```sql
-- Add indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX idx_assignment_submissions_assignment_id ON assignment_submissions(assignment_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_assignment_submissions_student_id ON assignment_submissions(student_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_exam_submissions_exam_id ON exam_submissions(exam_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_exam_submissions_student_id ON exam_submissions(student_id);
